# Short-packet transmissions with variable-length codes
This repository contains the `matlab` numerical routines used to  produce the numerical results in the paper:


> J. Östman, R. Devassy, G. Durisi, and E. G. Ström, “Short-packet transmission via variable-length codes in the presence of noisy stop feedback,” *IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.*, vol. 20, no. 1, Jan. 2021. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01049), [[IEEExplore]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9204378) 

Please, cite the aforementioned paper if you use this code.

## Content of the repository

This repository contains two main files:

- `Main_BiAwgn.m`, which allows one to reproduce the results for the binary-input AWGN case, and
- `Main_Rayleigh.m`, which allows one to reproduce the results for the Rayleigh-fading case.
